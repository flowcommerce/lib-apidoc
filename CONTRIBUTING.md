## Code Style

We use `.editorconfig` and `eslint` to enforce code quality standards. Please make sure your text editor is utilizing the editorconfig. The travis build will fail if eslint does not pass, so it's also recommended that your editor lints your code as you're writing it to avoid head aches when submitting pull request.
